Automatic Moderation Rules, or Moderation Rules (or simply "rules"), are a set of rules that are used to automatically moderate messages and user profiles in your server. These rules are used to filter out messages and user profiles that violate the rules you've set up.

## What are Moderation Rules and how do they work?

Moderation Rules are defined inside the guild-specific configuration file, and each rule may have an associated trigger condition and actions on trigger, alongside other behavior-controlling options.

Moderation Rules are **order-specific**, that means, the order in which the rules are defined in the configuration file matters. The first rule that matches the trigger condition will be executed, and the rest of the rules may or may not be ignored depending on the rule's configuration.

## Configuring Moderation Rules

To configure Moderation Rules, you need to edit the guild-specific configuration file. The configuration file is located at `config/config.json`.
The object you should add/edit is `rule_moderation`. For example, a Moderation Rule configuration might look like this:

```json
{
    // This key is the Guild ID!
    "847638624836373764": {
        "rule_moderation": {
            "enabled": true,
            "rules": [
                { "type": "word_filter",  "words":    ["word1", "word2"],   "actions": [{ "type": "delete_message" }] },
                { "type": "regex_filter", "patterns": ["disc(o|0)rd\\.gg"], "actions": [{ "type": "delete_message" }] }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

We&rsquo;ll explain the configuration options in the next section.

## Rule Attributes

Each rule is an object defined inside the `rule_moderation.rules` array. The following attributes are available for each rule:

<ConfigOption 
    optionKey="rule.type"
    type="RuleTypeString"
>
The type of the rule. Currently, the following types are supported: 

* `word_filter`
* `regex_filter`

* `file_extension_filter`
* `repeated_text_filter`
* `mass_mention_filter`
* `image_filter`
* `embed_filter`
* `profile_filter`
* `ai_scan`
</ConfigOption>

<ConfigOption

<ConfigOption
